## Instructions

Our code can be found in \textbf{NAME HERE} ipython notebook, which can be accessed from our git repository: https://github.com/huihuifan/RBM-CS51. We annotate the purposes of each file in our GitHub ReadMe, but the code and output is in the \textbf{NAME HERE} notebook. We have also included the code in our zip file, which we submitted with this report.

## Implementation List

We implemented the following:

1. Restricted Boltzmann Machine

    a. Binary with Sigmoid Activation Function

    b. Continuous with Rectifier Linear Units

    c. Training with Contrastive-Divergence 1

    d. Training with Persistent Contrastive Divergence

2. Deep Belief Network stacking binary and continuous RBMs

3. Visualization Function to run, train, and plot the RBM and DBN

4. Multilayer Perceptron

5. Eigenface transformation of Continuous Faces in the Wild dataset

6. Datasets:

    a. Toy dataset of movie users

    b. MNIST handwriting dataset, binary and continuous

    c. Faces in the Wild dataset, binary and eigenfaces
